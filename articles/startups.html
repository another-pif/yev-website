                In the summer i was at my lowest point of life. I sold the company i was building for 4 years, and even though i earned a some money - the sell never happend if not the burnout, which turns out to be a real thing after all. 
                You see, for 4 years i was overachiver and workmaxxing to the point where i laught to just a thought about a burnout. But well, it happens. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Some things helped me overcome it and be a person once again - my girlfriend, walking, good food etc. But my ability to think about startups and generating ideas once again is restored only now, almost a year after the exit. 
            </p>
            <p>
                And let me tell you it feels good again. Just feeling the pressure and anexity of thoughts 'am i doing shit no one will ever like?' or 'wtf, seems like everyone do marketing in tiktok nowdays, how can i compete with this brainrot' - i'm once again in search of the ideas and enjoy the proccess of building something.
            </p>

            <h2>Joy of doing something</h2>
            
            <p>
                One thing i was impressed the most - how much coding changed over just a year. Before, i'm always gather a team and first mission was always to come up with the reason why they should work on it (usualy its money)
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, the more i write a prompts - the better results gets and i think now AI writes about 90% of code for app (and 100% of this website, but i'm sure its not a surprise for you lol)
            </p>
            <p>
                I have a feeling that i was born for this. As self taught developer i was never good at this and everyone was always overperfoming me. But i can design, create ideas, lead a team and write tech specs. I'm used to give developers and customers right prompt. 
            </p>
            <p>
                And now i just pompt the same to ai for 20$ a month
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm scarad a little but happy at the same time
            </p>

            <h2>walkmaxxing</h2>
            
            <p>
                And for last, i just want to write about what i doing rn and my approach to it.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                When i started to look for ideas for my current app, i, as always, searched for problems that i can relate and will enjoy building. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So, naturally, things that helped me to overcome burnout were first to consider. 
                After some time i stopped at walking and decided to do small fun walking app - tamagotchi for walking, with cute pets and daily goals. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Even thought i have some ideas on how to market it, i'm trying to think about it more like 'first brick' in my startups foundation (although my girl love the idea and always tell me i'm wrong and we will be working on cute tamagotchis forever lol)
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Anyway, i want to be a more public this time and study the writing, sales, and english in general to be really good at it. Maybe even achive my goal of 10k mrr in the end - and do something bigger once again
