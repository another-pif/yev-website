            For the whole year,  I was recovering from a burnout. Before that, I ran a development agency with 20+ team members and solid revenue.
            <br><br>
            Now, in my free time (which is all day) i love to walk, play tennis, games, and watch anime.
            <br><br>
            Still, money is running out FAST and my biggest fear that I'll have to get a real job again. so here i am, trying to build business from scratch again - but this time it should be more time friendly and fun. 
            <br><br>
            You can follow the journey on <a href="https://x.com/yevkollab" target="_blank">twitter</a> and once i upload my first app i want to track mrr on this page as well (should be fun i guess)
